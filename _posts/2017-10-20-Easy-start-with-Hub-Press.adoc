Someone made a video, but i don't think you'll need it...

== Choose a theme
The default theme is casper... Let's try another one. _uno_ and _saga_ themes are known for having a better code block support, so they seem to be a good choice for me. In order to do that, two possibilies: modify the hubpress/config.json file, or click the "settings" menu entry.
